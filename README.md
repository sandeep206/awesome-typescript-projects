Cycle’s core abstraction is your application as a pure function main() where inputs are read effects (sources) from the external world and outputs (sinks) are write effects to affect the external world. These I/O effects in the external world are managed by drivers: plugins that handle DOM effects, HTTP effects, etc.

```ts
function main(sources) {
  const decrement$ = sources.DOM
    .select('.decrement').events('click').mapTo(-1);

  const increment$ = sources.DOM
    .select('.increment').events('click').mapTo(+1);

  const action$ = xs.merge(decrement$, increment$);
  const count$ = action$.fold((x, y) => x + y, 0);

  const vtree$ = count$.map(count =>
    div([
      button('.decrement', 'Decrement'),
      button('.increment', 'Increment'),
      p('Counter: ' + count)
    ])
  );
  return { DOM: vtree$ };
}

## Library

### <font color='00A2E8'>**>>>[ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router) - The de-facto solution to flexible routing with nested views in AngularJS**</font>

[https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router)

UI-Router applications are modeled as a hierarchical tree of states. UI-Router provides a state machine to manage the transitions between those application states in a transaction-like manner.

![](images/ui-router.png)


### <font color='00A2E8'>**>>>[mobx](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx) - Simple, scalable state management.**</font>

[https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx)

MobX is a battle tested library that makes state management simple and scalable by transparently applying functional reactive programming (TFRP).
The philosophy behind MobX is very simple:

_Anything that can be derived from the application state, should be derived. Automatically._

which includes the UI, data serialization, server communication, etc.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mobxjs/mobx/master/docs/flow.png)

React and MobX together are a powerful combination. React renders the application state by providing mechanisms to translate it into a tree of renderable components. MobX provides the mechanism to store and update the application state that React then uses.

Both React and MobX provide very optimal and unique solutions to common problems in application development. React provides mechanisms to optimally render UI by using a virtual DOM that reduces the number of costly DOM mutations. MobX provides mechanisms to optimally synchronize application state with your React components by using a reactive virtual dependency state graph that is only updated when strictly needed and is never stale.
